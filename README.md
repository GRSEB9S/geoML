geoML
=====
unsupervised learning application on geo related data:
find databases to work with
develop general purpose algorithms and tools and display toolkit that can work with these databases. 

1. hypserspectral remote sensing data (cluster discovery, classification problems)
2. spectrum thing ?
3. analysis data for 

geological objectives:

1. Find new targets of interest: aqueous deposits, crustal composition
2. Separate the surface and atmosphere Provide information on spatial/seasonal variations in aerosols, H2O, CO2, and ices
3.
